function [ n, bin ] = histcnd( x, edges )
%HISTCND Histogram count for n dimensional data.
% N = HISTCND(X,EDGES), for row vectors X, counts the number of values in
% X that fall between the grid defined by the cell array of EDGES, each
% of whose element is a vector that contain monotonically non-decreasing
% values. N is an N-D array each of whose dimension corresponds to
% LENGTH(EDGES{j}) and each element contains a count of data that falls
% into the edge.
%
% EDGES must have the same length to the number of columns of X.
% Alternatively, EDGES can be a numeric vector which gives a uniform
% grid for all dimensions of X.
% 
% N(k1,k2,...) will count the vector X(i,:) if for each dimension
% j = 1,2,..., EDGES{j}(kj) <= X(i,j) < EDGES{j}(kj+1). The last bin will
% count any values of X that match EDGES(end).  Values outside the values
% in EDGES are not counted. Use -Inf and Inf in EDGES to include all
% non-NaN values.
% 
% [N,BIN] = HISTCND(X,EDGES) also returns subscript indices BIN.
% BIN is zero for out of range values.
% 
% Example:
%     >> X = randn(100,2);          % 100-by-2 row vectors
%     >> edges = {-2:.4:2,-2:.5:2}; % ranges for each dimension
%     >> histcnd(X,edges)
