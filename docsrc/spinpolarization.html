<h1>Spin-polarized systems</h1>

<p>
EasySpin can simulate some spin-polarized systems such as triplets. Depending on the mechanism of spin polarization, you need to use different approaches. In this user guide, there are the following topics:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#photoselection">Photoselection</a>
<li><a href="#isc">Inter-system crossing (ISC) triplets</a>
<li><a href="#recomb">Recombination triplets</a>
<li><a href="#radpairs">Spin-correlated radical pairs</a>
</ul>

<p>
Although the second and third section focus on triplets, the methods can easily be extended to spin-polarized states of spins with higher multiplicity. For related <a href="examplesmain.html">examples</a> see the section on 'EPR simulations for photoexcited systems'.
</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<div class="subtitle"><a name="photoselection">Photoselection</a></div>

<p>
Spin-polarized systems are typically generated using photoexcitation with a laser. Excited triplet states are a common example. The triplet yield upon photoexcitation depends on the relative orientation between the E-field vector of the incident laser beam and the electric transition dipole moment vector associated with the optical transition that is being excited at the wavelength of the indicent laser beam. If the E-field is parallel to the transition dipole moment, the excitation is maximal, and if the E-field is perpendicular to the transition dipole moment, the excitation is zero. This phenomenon is called photoselection. As a consequence, in a powder or frozen-solution sample, not all orientations contribute equally to the EPR spectrum.
</p>

<p>
To take photoselection into account when simulating an EPR spectrum  with <a class="esf" href="pepper.html">pepper</a>, you need to provide information about the transition dipole moment orientation and about the laser excitation geometry.
</p>

<p>
Use <code>Sys.tdm</code> to provide the orienttion of the transition dipole moment in the molecule. For example, for the transition dipole moment along the molecular y axis, use one of the following three equivalent ways:
</p>

<pre class="matlab">
Sys.tdm = 'y';          % letter code
Sys.tdm = [0;1;0];      % unit vector
Sys.tdm = [pi/2 pi/2];  % polar angles (in radians)
</pre>

<p>
Use <code>Exp.lightBeam</code> to specify the laser excitation geometry, i.e. the laser propagation direction and the polarization angle (if the laser light is polarized). Several common geometries can be provided via keywords. They all assume a laser beam, polarized or unpolarized, propagating along the laboratory y axis, wich is perpendicular to the magnetic field (lab z axis).
</p>

<pre class="matlab">
Exp.lightBeam = 'unpolarized';     % unpolarized beam
Exp.lightBeam = 'perpendicular';   % polarized beam with E-field along lab x, perpendicular to B0
Exp.lightBeam = 'parallel';        % polarized beam with E-field along lab z, parallel to B0
</pre>

<p>
For other geometries, the propagation direction <code>k</code> and the polarization angle <code>alpha</code> can be provided explicitly as <code>Exp.lightBeam = {k alpha}</code>. Refer to the documentation of <a class="esf" href="pepper.html">pepper</a> for details about this.
</p>

<p>
The photoselection weights are calculated via the function <a class="esf" href="photoselect.html">photoselect</a>, which you can use directly for examining the orientation dependence of the photoexcitation yield.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally, when fitting experimental spectra of photo-excited species, it is necessary to include a small contribution with isotropic excitation (i.e. with E-field uniformly distributed in all directions) to account for scattering. The fraction of this contribution, betwenn 0 and 1, is provided in <code>Exp.lightScatter</code>.
</p>

<pre class="matlab">
Exp.lightScatter = 0.2;  % 20% isotropic contribution
</pre>

<p>
If you don't specify <code>Exp.lightBeam</code>, full isotropic excitation is assumed.
</p>

<div class="subtitle"><a name="isc">Inter-system crossing (ISC) triplets</a></div>

<p>
To simulate the EPR spectrum of a triplet generated by inter-system crossing from a singlet state, EasySpin needs information about how ISC populated the zero-field triplet states. You can provide this information in the field <code>Sys.Pop</code>.

<p>
<code>Sys.Pop</code> should contain a list of populations, one entry for each state. The populations apply to the <em>zero-field states</em> in increasing energy order. For example, <code>Sys.Pop = [0.1, 1, 0.2]</code> indicates a population of 0.1 of the lowest zero-field state, a population of 1 of the middle-energy zero-field state, and a population of 0.2 of the highest-energy zero-field state. The populations do not have to add up to 1.

<p>
The zero-field states in a triplet are usually denoted Tx, Ty, Tz. Their energy order depends on the signs of the zero-field splitting parameters D and E. Be careful in determining their order correctly when using <code>Sys.Pop</code> to simulate spectra from the literature, or when interpreting results from least-squares fitting.

<p>
Here is a full example of a triplet generated by ISC from a singlet
<pre class="matlab">
clear

T.S = 1;
T.D = [500 100];   % MHz
T.lwpp = 1;   % mT
T.Pop = [0.1 1 0.2]; % zero-field populations

Exp.mwFreq = 9.5;  % GHz
Exp.Range = [310 370];  % mT
Exp.Harmonic = 0;     % no field modulation

pepper(T,Exp);
</pre>

<p>
The shape of the EPR spectrum only depends on the <em>polarizations</em> of the transitions, i.e. only on the <em>differences</em> of the populations in <code>Sys.Pop</code>. Adding any constant to all three numbers will not affect the shape of spectrum. It will, however, affect the overall intensity of the simulated spectrum, since EasySpin scales the spectrum to the total population (sum over all numbers in <code>Sys.Pop</code>).

<p>
EasySpin can handle ISC-polarized spins of higher multiplicity as well. For example,to simulate spectra from an ISC-generated quartet state, provide 4 numbers in <code>Sys.Pop</code>.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<div class="subtitle"><a name="recomb">Recombination triplets</a></div>

<p>
To simulate the spin-polarized EPR spectrum of a triplet generated by recombination of two radicals, use the following two-step procedure. First, simulate the spectrum of the unpolarized triplet and ask EasySpin to return the two transitions separately. Second, combine the transitions using weighing factors corresponding to the polarizations of the transitions.

<p>
Here is an example. First, we set up the triplet and simulate its spectrum, without any spin polarization. With <code>Opt.Output</code>, request that <code>pepper</code> returns the transitions separately.

<pre class="matlab">
clear
T.S = 1;
T.D = 500;   % MHz
T.lwpp = 1;
Exp.mwFreq = 9.5;
Exp.Range = [310 370];
Exp.Harmonic = 0;                % no field modulation
Opt.Output = 'separate';         % separate transitions!
[B,spcsep,tr] = pepper(T,Exp,Opt);
</pre>

<p>
<code>tr</code> contains the list of transitions, with one row for each transition. <code>spc</code> contains the spectra of the two transitions separately, again one per row. Next, combine these two subspectra using differences in populations:
</p>

<pre class="matlab">
Popul = [0 1 0];                                 % vector of populations
Pola = [Popul(1)-Popul(2), Popul(2)-Popul(3)];   % polarizations
spc = Pola(1)*spcsep(1,:) + Pola(2)*spcsep(2,:); % polarized spectrum
plot(B,spc)
</pre>

<p>
Currently, EasySpin does not have built-in capabilities for simulating EPR spectra from spin-correlated radical pairs.
