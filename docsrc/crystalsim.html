<h1>Simulation of crystal spectra</h1>

<p>
EasySpin can simulate powder spectra as well as single-crystal spectra. For powder spectra, it is only necessary to specify the spin system, incl. the orientations of all the tensors within the molecule or paramagnetic center, and basic experimental parameters such as microwave frequency and magnetic field sweep range. For crystal spectra, EasySpin needs some additional information: (a) the symmetry of the crystal, (b) the orientation of the molecule or paramagnetic center within the crystal, (c) the orientation of the crystal relative to the spectrometer.
</p>

<p>
In the following, we show how to simulate a crystal spectrum, and how to simulate a series of spectra obtained by rotating a crystal in the spectrometer.
</p>

<p>
To understand the following, make sure you have read the documentation on the various <a href="frames.html">frames</a> that are used by EasySpin: the <em>lab frame</em>, the <em>crystal frame</em>, the <em>molecular frame</em>, and the <em>tensor frames</em>. This understanding is very important.
</p>

<p>
Everything below is applicable to all solid-state simulation functions: <a class="esf" href="pepper.html">pepper</a> (for cw EPR), <a class="esf" href="salt.html">salt</a> (for ENDOR), <a class="esf" href="saffron.html">saffron</a> (pulse EPR). It also is applicable to functions that compute resonance frequencies and fields, such as <a class="esf" href="resfields.html">resfields</a> etc.
</p>

<div class="subtitle"><a <a name="frames">Single-crystal spectrum</a></div>

<p>
Let's start with a simple spin system and a simple cw-EPR experiment. The following simulates the powder spectrum
</p>

<pre class="matlab">
clear
Sys.g = [2.0 2.1 2.2];
Sys.lw = 1;
Exp.mwFreq = 9.5;
Exp.Range = [300 350];
pepper(Sys,Exp);
</pre>

<p>
In order to simulate a crystal spectrum, you need to include three additional pieces of information: (1) the symmetry of the crystal, (2) the orientation of the molecule or paramagnetic center within the crystal, (3) the orientation of the crystal in the spectrometer.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Use <code>Exp.CrystalSymmetry</code> to give the crystal symmetry. It can be the symbol for the space group (such as <code>'P212121'</code>), the number of the space group (between 1 to 230), or the symbol of the point sub-group of the space group (such <code>'mmm'</code> or <code>'C2h'</code>). If you omit <code>Exp.CrystalSymmetry</code>, it is assumed to be the simplest space group <code>'P1'</code>, with one center per unit cell.

<li>
Use <code>Exp.MolFrame</code> to specify the orientation of the molecule (paramagnetic center) within the crystal. If there are multiple symmetry-related sites, pick one of them. <code>Exp.MolFrame</code>gives the <a href="eulerangles.html">Euler angles</a> for the transformation from the crystal frame to the molecular frame. Check out the documentation on <a href="frames.html">frames</a> for details on this. If you omit <code>Exp.MolFrame</code>, then it is assumed to be <code>[0 0 0]</code>. This means that the molecular frame is assumed to be collinear with the crystal frame.

<li>
Use <code>Exp.CrystalOrientation</code> to give the orientation of the crystal in the spectrometer. This field gives the three <a href="eulerangles.html">Euler angles</a> for the transformation from the crystal frame to the laboratory frame. See the page on <a href="frames.html">frames</a> for details.
</ol>

So, here is a full example:
<pre class="matlab">
Exp.CrystalSymmetry = 'P21/c';        % space group #14
Exp.MolFrame = [0 0 0];               % molecular frame aligned with crystal frame
Exp.CrystalOrientation = [0 pi/4 0];  % crystal frame tilted against lab frame
pepper(Sys,Exp);
</pre>

<p>
In space group P21/c, there are four sites per unit cell. Two each are magnetically equivalent, so one expects a maximum of two lines in the spectrum. With the settings as above, you will always see only a single line in the spectrum, no matter how you align the crystal in the lab.
The reason is that the g tensor frame is collinear with the crystal frame, so all four sites have the same EPR spectrum.
</p>

<p>
In order to see two lines, you need to have a tilt between the g tensor frame and the crystal frame. This can be set either in <code>Exp.MolFrame</code> or in <code>Sys.gFrame</code>. The first will tilt the molecular frame of the spin center, and thereby tilt all tensors of the molecule, relative to the crystal. The second will only tilt the g tensor frame (and not other tensors of the spin center) relative to the molecular frame.
(Refer to the reference page on <a href="frames.html">frames</a> for details.)
</p>

<pre class="matlab">
Exp.MolFrame = [20 40 10]*pi/180;
pepper(Sys,Exp);
</pre>

<div class="subtitle"><a <a name="frames">Crystal rotations</a></div>

<p>
In order to simulate a series of spectra that result from the rotation of a crystal in the spectrometer, use the field <code>Exp.SampleRotation</code>, which implements the sample rotation.
</p>

<p>
Let's start with a spin system and an initial crystal orientation
</p>

<pre class="matlab">
clear
Sys.g = [2.0 2.1 2.2];
Sys.lw = 1;
Exp.mwFreq = 9.5;
Exp.Range = [300 350];
Exp.CrystalSymmetry = 130;
Exp.MolFrame = [10 60 -34]*pi/180;    % molecular frame tilted within crystal
Exp.CrystalOrientation = [0 40 0]*pi/180; % initial crystal orientation in lab frame
pepper(Sys,Exp);
</pre>

<p>
This will give the spectrum for the initial crystal orientation. Now add the rotation axis (in lab coordinates) and the rotation angle (in radians) in <code>Exp.SampleRotation</code>:
</p>

<pre class="matlab">
rho = deg2rad(10);                        % sample rotation angle (radians)
nRot_L = [1;0;0];                         % sample rotation axis = x axis of lab frame
Exp.SampleRotation = {rho,nRot_L};
pepper(Sys,Exp);
</pre>

<p>
This will give the spectrum of the crystal rotated by <code>rho</code> around the rotation axis <code>nRot_L</code> starting from its initial orientation given in <code>Exp.CrystalOrientation</code>.
</p>

<p>
To rotate an EPR sample tube in a common setup with horizontal static field (permanent or electrmagnet) and vertical microwave magnetic field (as in cavity or dielectric resonators), the rotation axis is the laboratory x axis (<code>nRot_L=[1;0;0]</code> or <code>nRot_L='x'</code>). Since this is so common, for this case you can omit the axis definition. The following three forms are fully equivalent:
</p>
   
<pre class="matlab">
Exp.SampleRotation = {rho,[1;0;0]};   % most general form
Exp.SampleRotation = {rho,'x'};       % shorthand notation for rotation axis
Exp.SampleRotation = rho;             % implies that the rotation axis is 'x'
</pre>

<p>
You can simulate a series of crystal spectra that result from successive small-step rotations around the same rotation axis using a loop:
</p>

<pre class="matlab">
rho = deg2rad(0:15:180);             % 15 degree increments
for k = 1:numel(rho)
  Exp.SampleRotation = rho(k);
  [B,spc(:,k)] = pepper(Sys,Exp);
end
stackplot(B,spc);
</pre>

<div class="subtitle"><a <a name="frames">Site-selective simulations</a></div>

<p>
In a crystal simulation, EasySpin will first determine the number of magnetically equivalent sites in the crystal from the symmetry given in <code>Exp.CrystalSymmetry</code>. Then, it will simulate the EPR spectra of all sites and sum them up to obtain the overall crystal spectrum.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally, it is useful to look at the EPR spectra of the single sites separately. You can tell EasySpin to simulate only a specific subset of sites (e.g. just one) by specifying the site index in <code>Opt.Sites</code>. This field should contain a list of site indices. The number of sites depends on the space group given in <code>Exp.CrystalSymmetry</code>. E.g. the following set limits a crystal simulation to site 3 of the 4 magnetically distinct sites in crystal of space group no. 47.
</p>

<pre class="matlab">
Exp.CrystalSymmetry = 47;  % space group Pmmm
Opt.Sites = [1 3];         % simulate only site 3
</pre>

<p>
If <code>Opt.Sites</code> is empty or not given, all sites are included.  In powder simulations, <code>Opt.Sites</code> is ignored.
