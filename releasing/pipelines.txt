using ssh-key pair to allow bitbucket pipeline to login into tigress

on bitbucket:
 - create a key pair if necessary (Settings --> Pipelines --> SSH keys)
 - if a key pair is shown there already, you don't need to do it
 - copy the public key
 
  - the buildserver must be registered among the known hosts
	- currently tigress is registered
	- this needs to be redone if the build server is changed or if tigress is reset
 
on the build machine:
 - add the public key to the authorized_keys: 
	echo public_key_string >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
		where public_key_string is the public key, starting with ssh-rsa AAAA...
 - if necessary chmod -R go= ~/.ssh
