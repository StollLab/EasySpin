% fitting the spectrum of pentacene anion radical

% Here is an example you can play with: the simultaneous fitting
% of four hyperfine constants.
% This is a rather difficult fitting problem, if no pre-analysis of the
% spectrum is done to narrow down the ranges of the hyperfine coupling
% constants.
% It is therefore important to make every possible effort to get good
% starting values and narrow search ranges for the parameters, e.g. by
% looking up relevant literature or running quantum chemical predictions.
