% fitting the spectrum of pentacene anion radical

% Here is an example you can play with: the simultaneous fitting
% of four hyperfine constants.
% It represents a rather difficult fitting problem,
% if no pre-analysis of the spectrum is done to narrow
% down the ranges of the hyperfine coupling constants.
% Bottom line: always analyse your experimental spectra
% as thoroughly as possible before you try to least-squares
% fit the spectra.

% Compute a noisy spectrum
