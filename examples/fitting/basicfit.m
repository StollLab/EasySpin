% Basic example of spectral fitting using EasySpin
%====================================================================
clear

% Since we don't have any experimental data available, let's create some mock
% data by simulating a spectrum and adding some noise. If you use this example
% as a basis for your fittings, replace this code by code that loads your
% experimental data.

Sys.g = [2 2.1 2.2];
Sys.Nucs = '1H';
Sys.A = [120 50 78];
Sys.lwpp = 1;
Exp.mwFreq = 10;
Exp.Range = [300 380];
[B,spc] = pepper(Sys,Exp);
spc = addnoise(spc,150,'n');

% Now we set up the least-squares fitting. First comes a starting set of
% parameters (which we obtain by copying the spin system from the simulation
% and changing a few values).
Sys0 = Sys;
Sys0.A = [100 50 78];
Sys0.g(1) = 1.98;

% Next, we specify which parameter we want to be fitted and by how much the
% fitting algorithm can vary it approximately.
Vary.g = [0.1 0 0];
Vary.A = [30 0 0];

% We also can provide options for the simulation function.
SimOpt.Method = 'perturb';

% Finally, we specify the fitting algorithm and what should be fitted.
FitOpt.Method = 'simplex int'; % simplex algorithm, integrals of spectra

esfit(@pepper,spc,Sys0,Vary,Exp,SimOpt,FitOpt);

% If the fitting algorithm doesn't find the correct minimum, you can change
% the algorithm, target function, and starting point in the UI. For example,
% run Monte Carlo for a bit, save the best fit, and then use that as the
% starting point with Nelder/Mead to close in on the correct fit.
